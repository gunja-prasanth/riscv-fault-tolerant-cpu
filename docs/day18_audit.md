# 🟩 Day-18: Code Audit & Freeze Summary

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of Day-18 is to perform a **formal audit of the existing RTL and testbench codebase** to ensure it meets **interview-level and research-level coding standards**, without introducing unnecessary risk by modifying stable logic.

---

## 🔍 Audit Scope

A comprehensive review was conducted covering the following aspects:

- 🧩 **Signal Naming Consistency**  
  Ensured all signals follow clear, self-explanatory, and uniform naming conventions.

- 📝 **Module-Level Documentation**  
  Verified the presence of meaningful comments describing module purpose and behavior.

- 🧹 **Unused / Redundant Logic Check**  
  Confirmed absence of dead code, unused signals, or leftover debug constructs.

---

## ✅ Audit Outcome

✔ **No changes required**  
✔ Existing RTL already adheres to **professional, interview-grade coding practices**  
✔ Design quality is suitable for **academic evaluation and research discussion**

The decision was made to **freeze the RTL** to avoid introducing regressions into a verified and stable design.

---

## 🧪 Verification Status

- All existing simulations were **re-run successfully**
- No functional regressions observed
- Previous waveform proofs remain valid

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

This audit confirms that the project has maintained **high code quality from the early stages**, allowing the focus to shift confidently toward **formal verification and advanced features** in the subsequent phases.
