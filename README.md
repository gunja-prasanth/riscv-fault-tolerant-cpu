# RISC-V Fault-Tolerant CPU

## Project Overview
This project implements a Single-Cycle RISC-V CPU with RTL-level
error detection and recovery mechanisms.

## Day-1 Progress
- Understood RISC-V single-cycle CPU architecture
- Created Vivado RTL project
- Organized clean folder structure for RTL, testbench, and docs

## CPU Type
- Architecture: RISC-V RV32I
- Implementation: Single-Cycle

## Folder Structure
rtl/      -> RTL modules (PC, ALU, Regfile, Control, Memory)
tb/       -> Testbenches
docs/     -> Documentation
