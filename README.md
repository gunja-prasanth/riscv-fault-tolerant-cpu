## 🧠 Fault Model (RTL-Level)

The system detects **control-path faults**, including:

- ❌ Illegal opcode patterns  
- ❌ Invalid control signal combinations  
- ❌ Stuck-at control signals  

Faults are **classified**, not blindly handled:

| Fault Type | Description              | Action Taken |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Minor     | Recoverable inconsistency| Controlled recovery |
| Critical  | Unsafe state risk        | Immediate freeze |

---

## 🔁 Recovery FSM

The heart of the design is a **synchronous Moore FSM**:

| State   | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| NORMAL | Fault-free execution |
| FREEZE | Stop PC & writes |
| RECOVER | Roll back & correct |
| RESUME | Controlled restart |

✔ Clean reset  
✔ Safe defaults  
✔ No combinational loops  

---

## 🧯 Safety Mechanisms

### 1️⃣ Control Freeze Logic
- PC write disabled
- Register & memory writes masked
- Guarantees **no state corruption**

### 2️⃣ Recovery Action Logic
- PC rollback to the last known safe value
- NOP insertion to flush bad instructions
- Retry enable for safe re-execution

### 3️⃣ Safe Control MUX
- Final arbitration point
- **Safety always has a priority**
- Prevents unsafe control leakage

---

## ⚙️ Configurability (Day-20 Feature)

Fault tolerance can be enabled or disabled via parameter:

```verilog
parameter ENABLE_FAULT_TOLERANCE = 1'b1
```

| Mode | Behavior |
|----|---------|
| `1` | Full fault detection + recovery |
| `0` | Pure normal control path |

This allows:
- Performance comparison
- Area vs safety tradeoff analysis
- Research-level experimentation

---

## 🧪 Verification Strategy

✔ Unit-level testbenches for each block  
✔ Fault injection tests  
✔ Corner case testing:
- Back-to-back faults
- Reset during fault
- Fault during recovery  

✔ System-level integration testbench  

---

## ✅ Formal Safety Assertions (SystemVerilog)

Key guarantees are **formally asserted**:

- ❗ No writes during fault
- 🔁 Recovery eventually resumes
- 🧱 No deadlock states

Assertions are simulation-checked and aligned with FSM behavior.

---

## 📊 Results Summary

- ✔ Faults detected within bounded cycles
- ✔ No illegal writes during faults
- ✔ Deterministic recovery
- ✔ Minimal performance overhead
- ✔ Clean synthesis & elaboration

# 🔬 Phase-2 Extension: Activity-Aware Power & Performance Estimation

---

## 📌 Overview
This project is extended with a **passive, activity-aware estimation layer**
that enables **early-stage power and performance analysis** at the RTL
**control-logic level**.

✔ The estimation logic **observes** control behavior  
✔ It does **NOT** affect functional execution  
✔ It does **NOT** alter timing or fault-tolerance guarantees  

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Early power and performance evaluation is essential for architectural
trade-off analysis, particularly in **fault-tolerant systems** where
recovery mechanisms introduce overhead.

⚠️ Gate-level simulation and post-implementation power analysis are:
- expensive
- technology-dependent
- unsuitable for early design decisions

This extension focuses on:
✔ **RTL-level estimation**  
✔ **Technology-agnostic modeling**  
✔ **Fast, proxy-based analysis**

---

## 🧩 Estimation Architecture
The estimation layer is integrated **passively** within the fault-tolerant
control subsystem and consists of the following components:

### 🔹 Activity Monitor
✔ Counts FSM state transitions  
✔ Tracks PC write toggles  
✔ Measures recovery-active cycles  

### 🔹 Power Estimator
✔ Maps activity counts to a **relative power proxy**  
✔ Uses configurable, unit-less weights  
✔ Avoids voltage, frequency, and process assumptions  

### 🔹 Performance Estimator
✔ Measures recovery-induced execution overhead  
✔ Computes integer-based overhead percentages  
✔ Operates without timing or clock-rate assumptions  

🔒 **All estimation outputs are observational only** and do **NOT** influence
control or datapath behavior.

---

## 📚 Research Alignment
This extension is inspired by and aligned with prior research on
early-stage estimation and design-space exploration:

### 🔸 Rajesh Kedia et al.
✔ Early evaluation of performance and energy trade-offs  
✔ Architectural-level analysis without exhaustive simulation  
✔ Motivation for lightweight, proxy-based estimation  

### 🔸 Amit Acharyya et al.
✔ RTL-level activity propagation for power estimation  
✔ Avoidance of gate-level simulation  
✔ Emphasis on fast, inductive estimation methodologies  

📌 The implementation reflects these ideas at the **control-logic level**
rather than datapath or circuit level.

---

## 🔍 Verification Strategy
✔ Incremental integration with **waveform regression checks**  
✔ Identical simulation behavior before and after integration  
✔ Elaborated design inspection confirms **non-intrusive operation**  

🛡 This ensures the estimation layer does **NOT** affect:
- functional correctness
- control flow
- timing behavior

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
❗ The estimated metrics represent **relative trends**, not absolute power  
❗ No technology-specific parameters (voltage, frequency, process) modeled  
❗ Does not replace gate-level or silicon measurements  

These limitations are **intentional** to preserve:
✔ early-stage applicability  
✔ architectural independence  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway
> **Fault-tolerant control behavior can be quantified at RTL for power and
performance trends without compromising correctness or requiring costly
post-implementation analysis.**
